I am (Full) Professor at the Faculty of Science and Engineernig,Computing Department at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia. 

I am the Executive Director of the Optus Macquarie University Cyber Security Hub and director of the Data Security and Privacy Research Program. 

With a team of collaborators I am interested in the broad R&D activities in Cyber Security in Emerging Technologies with a vision to enable Explicit Trust in the Digital Economy. My primary research interests are Data Security and Privacy, with a focus on Privacy-Preserving (or Enhancing) technologies and Information Security for Web and Mobile applications, (Provably) private date sharing and Trustworthy Secure and Private Machine learning techniques. 

Prior to joining Macquarie University, I was founder and group leader of the Information Security and Privacy group at CSIRO Data61, a principal researcher at National ICT Australia (NICTA) and a permament researcher at the Privatics team at INRIA in France.
