I am (Full) Professor at the Department of Computing, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia. 
I am the Exacutive Director of the Optus Macquarie University Cyber Security Hub and director of the Data Security and Privacy Research Program. 

I am interested in the wide R&D activities in privacy-preserving technologies with a focus on private date sharing, Information security and Web and mobile security. Prior to joining Macquarie Universirty, I was group leader and founder of the Information Security and Privacy group at CSIRO Data61, a principal researcher at National ICT Australia (NICTA) and a permament researcher at the Privatics team at INRIA in France.

Our main research goals are:
======
Build data and information sharing platforms enabling privacy-preserving data sharing and trustworthy cyber defence collaboration.
Design and construct resilient and reliable software systems to enable defence mechanisms in distributed and potentially hostile environments.

Design and build usable and human-centric security technologies to change humans from the weakest link of the chain into a first line of active defence.

Quantify and understand threats and cyber risks including socio-economics and financial risks.

Design policies, governance and decision-making platforms to investigate regulation-compliance and facilitate cyber security mechanisms embedding within organisations.
